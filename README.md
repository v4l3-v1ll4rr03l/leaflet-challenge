To view map in browser:

1. Click the green button labeled 'Code'
2. From the choices opened, click the last option 'Download ZIP'
3. Open the application you use to store and organize files in your computer (Finder on Mac or File Explorer on Windows)
4. Locate the file you just downloaded (should be named 'leaflet-challenge.zip')
5. Open this file and unzip (will happen automatically by clicking the file on Mac, but will require you to find and press the 'Extract All' button on Windows)
6. Once you have done this, open the new unzipped folder (should just be labeled 'leaflet-challenge')
7. Click the 'index.html' file in the folder (this will automatically open the map in your browser)
